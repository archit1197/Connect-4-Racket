This is our CS152 Project repository.
Please find in this folder four racket files (extension .rkt) namely :
1.main.rkt
2.connect4.rkt
3.position.rkt
4.drawing-routine.rkt

Also, two pdf documents CS152ProjectReport.pdf and Heuristicsandcodeimprovements.pdf are enclosed.

Run the project by opening main.rkt in a racket compiler and running it. A dialog box having a 6X7 grid should open up.

Hope you enjoy!
